# ACT Energy Cycle Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ATP/ADP semifungible token infrastructure with society treasury on the ACT blockchain. This enables the Web4 energy economy where societies own token pools and roles manage allocations.

## Phase Completion Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Token Types
- Created SocietyPool protobuf message structure
- Defined ATP (charged) and ADP (discharged) as distinct coin states
- Added metadata fields for tracking work and energy sources

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Society Storage
- Implemented complete society pool keeper methods
- Created CRUD operations for pool management
- Added society pool key to collections storage

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: CLI Integration
- Fixed autocli.go positional arguments for mint-adp
- Wired up all three operations (mint/discharge/recharge)
- Commands now accept proper parameters

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Energy Cycle
- Connected MintADP to society pool storage
- Wired DischargeATP to convert ATP‚ÜíADP for work
- Implemented RechargeADP to convert ADP‚ÜíATP with energy

### üîÑ Phase 5: Testing (In Progress)
- Created test script for complete cycle
- Ready to validate pool balances
- Need to run integration tests

## Key Components

### 1. Society Pool Structure
```go
type SocietyPool struct {
    SocietyLct      string
    AtpBalance      Coin    // Charged energy tokens
    AdpBalance      Coin    // Discharged energy tokens
    LastUpdate      int64
    TotalMinted     string
    TotalDischarged string
    TotalRecharged  string
    MetabolicState  string
    TreasuryRole    string
    Metadata        map[string]string
}
```

### 2. Energy Operations

#### Mint ADP (Treasury Role)
```bash
racecar-webd tx energycycle mint-adp [amount] [society-lct] [role-lct] [reason]
```
- Only treasury role can mint initial ADP
- Updates society pool balance
- Tracks total minted historically

#### Discharge ATP (Workers)
```bash
racecar-webd tx energycycle discharge-atp [worker-lct] [amount] [work-description] [target-lct]
```
- Converts ATP to ADP when work is performed
- Energy is conserved (ATP decreases, ADP increases)
- Tracks work performed for V3 validation

#### Recharge ADP (Producers)
```bash
racecar-webd tx energycycle recharge-adp [producer-lct] [amount] [energy-source] [validation-proof]
```
- Converts ADP back to ATP with real energy input
- Requires validation proof of energy generation
- Tracks energy sources (solar, wind, etc.)

## Implementation Files

### Modified Files
- `x/energycycle/module/autocli.go` - Fixed CLI parameter binding
- `x/energycycle/keeper/msg_server.go` - Wired pool operations
- `x/energycycle/types/keys.go` - Added SocietyPoolKey
- `proto/racecarweb/energycycle/v1/tx.proto` - MintADP message

### New Files
- `x/energycycle/keeper/society_pool.go` - Complete pool management
- `proto/racecarweb/energycycle/v1/society_pool.proto` - Pool structure
- `test-energy-cycle.sh` - Integration test script

## Energy Conservation Formula

```
ATP_in - ADP_out = Confirmed_Value + Energy_Invested
```

Where:
- **ATP_in**: Energy invested in work
- **ADP_out**: Discharged energy after work
- **Confirmed_Value**: V3 tensor validation of work value
- **Energy_Invested**: Learning cost (not waste!)

## Web4 Compliance

Current compliance score: **57%**

Areas needing improvement:
- Bidirectional witnessing
- R6 action framework
- Law oracle integration
- Complete V3 tensor validation

## Next Steps

1. Run integration tests with initialized blockchain
2. Verify pool balances persist across blocks
3. Test metabolic state transitions
4. Implement query endpoints for pool state
5. Add genesis initialization for society pools
6. Increase Web4 compliance to 80%+

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ Blockchain builds successfully
‚úÖ CLI accepts properly formatted commands
‚úÖ Society pool storage implemented
‚úÖ All three operations wired to pools
‚è≥ Pool balances update correctly
‚è≥ Energy is conserved in transitions
‚è≥ Events emit for tracking

## Swarm Contribution

This implementation was coordinated by the ATP/ADP Infrastructure Swarm with contributions from:
- **ATP-Economy-Queen**: Token mechanics and pool design
- **Demo-Society-Queen**: Society structure and role validation
- **LCT-Infrastructure-Queen**: CLI integration and LCT extensions
- **Web4-Compliance-Queen**: Standard validation and compliance checking

Total ATP Budget: 500 ATP
Status: Phase 4 Complete, Phase 5 In Progress
