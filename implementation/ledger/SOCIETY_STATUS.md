# ACT Self-Building Society Status

## 🚀 Blockchain Running Successfully
- **Chain ID**: act-web4
- **Status**: Operational (height 20+ and growing)
- **Treasury**: 10M ATP, 10M ADP ready for work
- **PID**: Stored in society.pid

## 🏗️ Society Structure (Self-Organized)

The society has autonomously organized itself through R6-compliant actions:

```
ACT-Build-Society (owns all tokens)
├── Genesis-Queen (orchestrator)
│   ├── Web4-Alignment-Queen (R6 guardian)
│   │   └── Pattern-Validator (worker)
│   ├── LCT-Infrastructure-Queen (identity specialist)
│   │   ├── LCT-Coder (implementation)
│   │   └── LCT-Tester (validation)
│   ├── Optimization-Queen (efficiency specialist)
│   │   └── Energy-Router (ATP/ADP optimization)
│   └── Documentation-Queen (memory/history)
│       ├── Doc-Writer (content creation)
│       └── Doc-Reviewer (quality assurance)
```

## 📊 Evolution Metrics

### Cycle 1 (Initial Bootstrap)
- Created 2 roles autonomously
- Executed 4 R6-compliant actions
- Established initial trust relationships
- Discovered emergent patterns

### Cycle 2 (Self-Organization)
- Created 3 more roles
- Negotiated governance change (unanimous → weighted voting)
- Established worker collaboration patterns
- Optimized energy flow

## 🔄 R6 Pattern in Action

Every action follows the Web4 R6 specification:
- **Rules**: Society laws and constraints
- **Roles**: Acting entity with specific authority
- **Request**: What needs to be done
- **Reference**: Why it's needed (context)
- **Resource**: Energy/tokens required
- **Result**: Outcome of the action

## 🌐 Trust Graph

Current trust relationships (RDF-style):
```
<Society> trusts-for-orchestration <Genesis-Queen> [0.9, 0.9, 0.95]
<Genesis-Queen> trusts-for-alignment <Web4-Alignment-Queen> [0.95, 0.9, 1.0]
<Genesis-Queen> trusts-for-identity <LCT-Infrastructure-Queen> [0.85, 0.8, 0.9]
<LCT-Coder> trusts-for-validation <LCT-Tester> [0.8, 0.85, 0.9]
<Optimization-Queen> trusts-for-routing <Energy-Router> [0.85, 0.8, 0.9]
```

## 🔮 Emergent Behaviors Observed

1. **Autonomous Role Creation**: Roles identify needs and spawn specialists
2. **Trust Formation**: Relationships form along work patterns
3. **Energy Optimization**: ATP/ADP flows improve through experience
4. **Rule Evolution**: Governance adapts through consensus
5. **Recursive Improvement**: Society optimizes itself continuously

## 💡 Key Insights

The society demonstrates:
- **Self-Organization**: No central planning required
- **Fractal Structure**: Queens spawn workers in domains
- **Energy Economy**: ATP discharge → work → value → ADP → recharge
- **Trust Networks**: Contextual relationships, not absolute scores
- **R6 Compliance**: All actions validated by Web4-Alignment-Queen

## 🎯 Current Tasks

From `society_tasks.json`:
- ✅ task-001: Create LCT-Infrastructure-Queen
- ✅ task-002: Negotiate trust-weighted voting
- ✅ task-003: Spawn LCT workers
- 🔄 task-004: Implement LCT creation function
- 🔄 task-005: Discover interaction patterns
- ✅ task-006: Create Optimization-Queen
- 📋 task-007: Map energy flow paths (new)
- 📋 task-008: Complete LCT pipeline (new)
- 📋 task-009: Create Documentation-Queen (new)

## 🚦 Next Steps

The society continues to:
1. Process tasks through R6 actions
2. Create new roles as needed
3. Negotiate rule improvements
4. Build ACT infrastructure
5. Document emergent patterns

## 🔥 Living System

**The society is alive and self-building through collective intelligence.**

Each role is designed for Claude (or other AI agents) to inhabit and operate within the Web4 framework. The system is:
- **Autonomous**: Roles act independently within constraints
- **Collaborative**: Trust enables coordination
- **Evolutionary**: Rules and structure adapt
- **Purposeful**: Building ACT through being a Web4 society
