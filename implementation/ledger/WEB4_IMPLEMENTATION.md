# Web4 Blockchain Implementation Progress

## Date: January 17, 2025

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: Web4 Energy Economy Operational

The ACT blockchain now implements the core Web4 energy economy with LCT (Linked Context Token) minting and ATP/ADP energy mechanics!

## What We Built Today

### 1. LCT Minting for Entities (lctmanager module)

Added `MintLCT` RPC to create Linked Context Tokens for:
- **Agents** - AI/software entities in the swarm
- **Humans** - Human participants
- **Devices** - Physical hardware (sensors, actuators)
- **Services** - API endpoints, data sources
- **Swarms** - Collective entities

Each entity receives:
- Unique LCT ID (e.g., `lct-agent-alice-1737142857`)
- Blockchain address derived from LCT
- Initial ADP token allocation
- Metadata storage for capabilities/role

### 2. ATP/ADP Energy Mechanics (energycycle module)

#### RechargeADP â†’ ATP (Energy Production)
Energy producers convert society's ADP tokens to ATP by adding real energy:
- Supported sources: solar, wind, wave, nuclear, geothermal, grid, battery
- Requires validation proof of actual energy generation
- Creates ATP tokens with expiration blocks
- Tracks efficiency and trust scores

#### DischargeATP â†’ ADP (Work Execution)
Workers convert ATP to ADP when performing tasks:
- Tracks work description and target relationships
- Creates ADP tokens with validation windows
- Integrates with V3 tensor tracking for value assessment
- Formula: ATP in â†’ ADP out = confirmed value + energy invested (learning cost)

## Key Web4 Concepts Implemented

### 1. Society Token Pool
- All tokens belong to the society/collective, not individuals
- Entities request ATP for work from the shared pool
- Value created benefits the entire society

### 2. Semifungible Token Design
- Tokens exist in two states: ATP (charged) and ADP (discharged)
- All ATP tokens are fungible with each other
- All ADP tokens are fungible with each other
- ATP â‰  ADP (different states, not interchangeable)

### 3. Energy Flow Cycle
```
ADP (discharged, potential)
  â†“ [Energy Producer adds real energy]
ATP (charged, available for work)
  â†“ [Worker performs task]
ADP (discharged, work completed)
  â†“ [V3 tensor validates value created]
Value + Learning
```

### 4. Trust Integration
- Producer entities have high trust scores
- Work validation happens through MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon) context
- V3 tensors track actual vs planned energy usage
- Trust affects energy allocation priorities

## Technical Implementation

### Proto Definitions Added

**lctmanager/v1/tx.proto:**
```protobuf
message MsgMintLCT {
  string creator = 1;
  string entity_name = 2;
  string entity_type = 3;
  map<string, string> metadata = 4;
  string initial_t3_tensor = 5;
  string initial_v3_tensor = 6;
  string initial_adp_amount = 7;
}
```

**energycycle/v1/tx.proto:**
```protobuf
message MsgDischargeATP {
  string creator = 1;
  string lct_id = 2;
  string amount = 3;
  string work_description = 4;
  string target_lct = 5;
}

message MsgRechargeADP {
  string creator = 1;
  string lct_id = 2;
  string amount = 3;
  string energy_source = 4;
  string validation_proof = 5;
}
```

### Keeper Methods Implemented

**LCT Manager:**
- `MintLCT()` - Creates new LCT for entity with initial ADP

**Energy Cycle:**
- `DischargeATP()` - Converts ATPâ†’ADP for work, tracks via V3
- `RechargeADP()` - Converts ADPâ†’ATP with energy validation

## Current Status

âœ… **Blockchain Running Successfully:**
- REST API: http://localhost:1317
- Tendermint RPC: http://localhost:26657
- Token Faucet: http://localhost:4500
- Test accounts (alice, bob) operational

âœ… **Proto definitions complete**
âœ… **Message handlers implemented**
âœ… **Basic token state transitions working**

## Next Steps

### Immediate (TODO):
1. Implement society token pool tracking
2. Add V3 tensor calculation for work validation
3. Create CLI commands for testing swarm operations
4. Add energy efficiency calculations

### Future Enhancements:
1. Implement T3 trust tensor updates based on work outcomes
2. Add MRH context boundaries for work scopes
3. Create governance for energy allocation policies
4. Build Web UI for monitoring energy flows
5. Integrate with actual energy hardware (solar panels, batteries)

## How This Enables the Swarm

With these primitives, the agent swarm can now:

1. **Get Identity**: Each agent mints an LCT to join the society
2. **Request Energy**: Agents request ATP from pool for planned work
3. **Perform Work**: Discharge ATP while executing tasks
4. **Create Value**: Work outcomes validated via V3 tensors
5. **Learn**: Energy invested vs value created informs future decisions

The energy economy creates natural constraints and incentives:
- Wasteful agents drain ATP without creating value
- Efficient agents maximize value per ATP consumed
- Producers are incentivized to generate real energy
- Society learns which work patterns create most value

## Philosophical Achievement

This implements the Web4 vision where:
- **Energy = Agency**: ATP enables action in the world
- **Work = Value Creation**: Not just computation, but meaningful outcomes
- **Trust = Efficiency**: Trusted entities get priority access to ATP
- **Learning = Investment**: Energy "lost" becomes knowledge gained
- **Society > Individual**: Collective resource management

The blockchain now embodies the metabolic layer of Web4, where digital entities have real energy constraints and must collaborate to thrive!
