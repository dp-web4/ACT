# ACT Blockchain Progress - January 17, 2025

## Major Achievements Today

### 1. Society Foundation Implementation ✅

We've established the core architecture for Web4 societies on the blockchain:

#### Role-Based LCT Structure
- **Roles are entities**, not just metadata - each role has its own LCT
- Society LCT serves as the parent entity
- Treasury Role LCT has authority to mint ADP
- Witness, Citizen, and Law Oracle roles defined
- Roles bind to society through witnessed relationships

#### Energy Economy Implementation
- **MintADP**: Treasury role can mint initial ADP allocation for society
- **DischargeATP**: Convert ATP to ADP when performing work
- **RechargeADP**: Energy producers convert ADP back to ATP
- **Society Pool Model**: All tokens belong to society, not individuals

### 2. Blockchain Operational ✅

- Successfully built with new proto messages
- Running on blocks ~39,600+
- All modules properly registered
- Proto generation working

### 3. Key Conceptual Breakthroughs

1. **"Idle isn't"** - Led to metabolic states for societies
2. **Roles as first-class entities** - Not just labels but LCTs with authority
3. **Treasury as minting authority** - Genesis allocation through role
4. **Energy flow clarity**:
   ```
   Treasury mints ADP → Producers charge to ATP → Workers discharge to ADP → Value created
   ```

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Blockchain running with all Web4 modules
- ✅ Proto definitions for society operations
- ✅ Keeper implementations for energy cycle
- ✅ Basic transaction structure

### What Needs Work
- ⚠️ CLI parameter binding (auto-generated CLI not matching proto)
- ⚠️ Actual LCT creation on chain
- ⚠️ Society state storage
- ⚠️ Role binding mechanism

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix CLI Integration
The auto-generated CLI for `mint-adp` isn't accepting parameters correctly. Need to:
- Check module's autocli.go configuration
- Ensure proper command registration
- Map proto fields to CLI flags

### 2. Create Foundation Entities
Once CLI works, create:
1. Society LCT (parent entity)
2. Treasury Role LCT (with mint authority)
3. Other role LCTs (witness, citizen, law oracle)
4. Bind roles to society

### 3. Test Energy Cycle
Complete flow test:
1. Treasury mints 1M ADP to society pool
2. Simulate producer charging ADP to ATP
3. Worker requests ATP allocation
4. Worker discharges ATP for work
5. Verify society pool balances

### 4. Connect Agent Swarm
- Mint LCTs for swarm agents
- Grant citizenship to agents
- Enable ATP allocation requests
- Track work through discharge

### 5. Implement State Storage
- Society pool balances
- Role-entity bindings
- Citizenship records
- Work history

## Technical Debt

### Immediate
- CLI parameter mapping
- State storage for society pools
- Role verification in transactions

### Short-term
- Proper role binding mechanism
- Society pool balance tracking
- Work validation proofs

### Long-term
- Metabolic state implementation
- Fractal society relationships
- Cross-society token flows

## Files Modified Today

### New Files
- `/scripts/create_genesis_society.sh` - Genesis society creation script
- `/implementation/SOCIETY_POOL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Pool model documentation
- `PROGRESS_2025_01_17.md` - This progress report

### Modified Files
- `/proto/racecarweb/energycycle/v1/tx.proto` - Added MintADP message
- `/x/energycycle/keeper/msg_server.go` - Implemented MintADP handler
- Multiple Web4 standard docs with society concepts

## Insights and Observations

### The Living Digital Society
Today's work revealed that digital societies aren't just organizational structures but living entities that:
- Expend energy maintaining presence (like the blockchain using 18% CPU "idle")
- Need metabolic states (active, rest, sleep, hibernation)
- Can evolve through molting
- Build collective intelligence through witnessed work

### Role Authority Pattern
Roles as LCT entities with specific authorities creates clean separation:
- Treasury role: Can mint ADP
- Witness role: Can validate work
- Citizen role: Can request allocations
- Law Oracle role: Can publish rules

This pattern scales fractally - roles can have sub-roles, societies can have sub-societies.

### Energy as Constraint
The ATP/ADP cycle enforces that value comes from work, not accumulation:
- Societies manage pools, individuals perform work
- Energy must flow to maintain value
- Demurrage prevents hoarding
- Learning costs (energy invested) are features, not bugs

## Tomorrow's Priority

**Get one complete energy cycle working end-to-end:**
1. Fix CLI
2. Create society with roles
3. Mint ADP
4. Charge to ATP
5. Discharge for work
6. Verify balances

Once we have this loop working, we can connect the swarm and start building the living society!
