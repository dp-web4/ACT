## Introduction

Web4-ModBatt-Demo (also known as "racecarweb") is a blockchain application designed to manage modular battery systems through distributed ledger technology. Built on the Cosmos SDK framework, it provides a decentralized infrastructure for component registration, trust management, energy tracking, and secure pairing between battery components.

> **Development Status**: This blockchain is currently in early development phase. The module structure, data types, and APIs are defined, but the core business logic is not yet implemented. All message handlers contain TODO placeholders.

This blockchain is intended to serve as the distributed ledger layer for a comprehensive battery management ecosystem, working in conjunction with embedded firmware for battery controllers (CellCPU, ModuleCPU, Pack-Controller-EEPROM) once integration is developed.

## Architecture Overview

The blockchain follows a modular architecture pattern with six custom modules, each handling specific aspects of the battery management system:

### Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each module is self-contained with its own state management, message handlers, and query endpoints
2. **Relationship-Based**: The system centers around relationships between components, using Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
3. **Trust-First**: Trust scoring mechanisms influence all operations through the Trust Tensor module
4. **Offline Support**: Built-in queuing mechanisms handle offline device scenarios
5. **Energy Tracking**: Comprehensive energy flow tracking and validation

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Cosmos SDK v0.50.x
- **Consensus**: CometBFT (Tendermint)
- **Language**: Go 1.22+
- **Build Tool**: Ignite CLI v28.0.0
- **API**: REST API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Protocol Buffers**: For message serialization
- **IBC**: Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol support

## Module Summary

### 1. Component Registry Module
Manages the identity and authorization of battery components in the system.

### 2. LCT Manager Module
Handles Linked Context Tokens that represent relationships between components.

### 3. Pairing Module
Manages bidirectional pairing operations between components with authentication.

### 4. Pairing Queue Module
Handles offline and queued pairing operations for components not currently online.

### 5. Energy Cycle Module
Manages energy operations, transfers, and balances between related components.

### 6. Trust Tensor Module
Implements trust scoring and relationship trust management using tensor mathematics.

## Key Features

### Component Management
- Register and verify component identities
- Manage authorization rules between components
- Track component relationships and pairings

### Energy Operations
- Create and execute energy transfers
- Track energy flow history
- Validate relationship values
- Manage ATP and ADP token operations

### Trust Management
- Calculate trust scores for relationships
- Track trust evolution over time
- Use witness data for trust verification

### Offline Support
- Queue operations for offline components
- Process queues when components come online
- Support proxy-based operations

## Use Cases

### 1. Modular Battery System Management
The blockchain enables secure management of modular battery systems where individual cells, modules, and packs can be:
- Registered and authenticated
- Paired with compatible components
- Track energy flow and usage
- Build trust relationships over time

### 2. Energy Trading and Tracking
Components can:
- Exchange energy based on trust scores
- Track energy provenance
- Validate energy operations
- Maintain energy balance records

### 3. Component Lifecycle Management
The system supports:
- Component registration at manufacture
- Relationship establishment during assembly
- Trust building through operational history
- Secure decommissioning and recycling

### 4. Distributed Battery Networks
Enable:
- Peer-to-peer energy sharing
- Trust-based energy routing
- Offline operation queuing
- Multi-party energy transactions
