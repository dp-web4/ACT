## Quick Start

Welcome to the Web4-ModBatt blockchain documentation. This system provides a decentralized infrastructure for managing modular battery systems through component registration, trust management, energy tracking, and secure pairing.

> ⚠️ **Development Status**: This blockchain is currently in early development. The architecture and data structures are defined, but core business logic is not yet implemented. All module message handlers contain TODO placeholders awaiting implementation.

### What is Web4-ModBatt?

Web4-ModBatt is a blockchain application built on the Cosmos SDK that **will enable**:
- **Component Identity Management**: Register and verify battery components
- **Secure Pairing**: Establish authenticated relationships between components  
- **Energy Operations**: Track and manage energy transfers
- **Trust Scoring**: Build and maintain trust relationships over time
- **Offline Support**: Handle operations when components are not immediately available

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Module structure and scaffolding
- Protocol buffer definitions
- REST API endpoints (OpenAPI)
- Event definitions
- Keeper structures
- Documentation framework

❌ **Not Yet Implemented**:
- Component registration logic
- Pairing authentication mechanisms
- Energy transfer execution
- Trust calculation algorithms
- LCT creation and management
- Queue processing for offline components
- Integration with Windows app/BMS

### Planned Features

- 🔐 **Cryptographic Security**: All operations secured with digital signatures
- 🔄 **Real-time Energy Tracking**: Monitor energy flows between components
- 📊 **Trust-based Operations**: Trust scores influence system permissions
- 🌐 **Offline Resilience**: Queue operations for offline components
- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: Six specialized modules working together
- 🔗 **Relationship-based**: LCTs manage all component interactions

## Core Concepts

Before diving into specific modules, understand these fundamental concepts:

### 🆔 Component Identity
Every battery component (cell, module, pack, controller) has a unique, cryptographically-secured identity registered on the blockchain.

### 🔗 Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
LCTs represent relationships between components, enabling secure interactions and defining permissions for operations.

### 🤝 Trust Tensors
Multi-dimensional trust scores that quantify the reliability and trustworthiness of component relationships over time.

### ⚡ Energy Operations
Tracked energy transfers between components with validation, history, and efficiency monitoring.

### 👥 Pairing Mechanisms
Secure authentication processes that establish trusted relationships between components.

### ⏳ Offline Support
Queuing mechanisms that handle operations when components are temporarily unavailable.

## BMS Integration Plans

### Planned Integration Architecture

The blockchain will integrate with the existing ModBatt BMS hierarchy:

```
Windows App → Pack Controller → Module Controllers → Cell Controllers
     ↓                                                        ↑
     └─────────────── Blockchain Integration ─────────────────┘
```

### Integration Components (Future Development)

#### 1. **BMS-Blockchain Bridge Service**
- Service running alongside Windows app
- Manages blockchain wallet/keys for BMS components
- Translates BMS events to blockchain transactions
- Monitors blockchain for relevant events

#### 2. **Component Registration Flow**
```
Pack Controller Power On
    ↓
Bridge Service Detects New Pack
    ↓
Register Pack on Blockchain
    ↓
Register Each Module as Discovered
    ↓
Create LCT Relationships
```

#### 3. **Energy Operation Tracking**
- Record charge/discharge cycles on blockchain
- Track energy efficiency per component
- Build trust scores based on performance

#### 4. **Data Synchronization**
- Periodic snapshots of BMS state to blockchain
- Event-driven updates for critical changes
- Offline queue for connectivity issues

### Integration Challenges

1. **Real-time Constraints**: BMS operates in milliseconds, blockchain in seconds
2. **Key Management**: Secure storage of blockchain keys in embedded systems
3. **Connectivity**: Battery systems may operate without internet access
4. **Transaction Costs**: Gas fees for frequent BMS operations
5. **Data Volume**: Balancing detail vs blockchain storage costs
